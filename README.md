## How to use our project:

- clone this repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/allyn8444/
   ```
- get Arduino IDE and upload `DreamCatcher.ino` file
- check the COM ports in your end
- create an `.env` file and put serial port value e.g. `SERIAL_PORT = COM5`
- run: `node .\app.js`
- then open: `http://localhost:3000`
- the web app should pop up after opening the localhost.

ENJOY!

## For notfications:
Arduino Uno should be connected to a computer or laptop to make the real time communication and notifications to work

## Limitation:

The Arduino Uno should be connected to a computer or laptop.
It won't be able to communicate data (to our web app) without a serial connection unless we will add additional modules.
